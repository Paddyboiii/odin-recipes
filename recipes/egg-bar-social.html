    <h2>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel 6 or 7 of the hardboiled eggs and place them in a large sealable container. Add pickled beets and their brine (1 or more jars, 
            depending on the size of your container) until the eggs are fully submerged in the brine.</li>
        <li>Let the eggs marinate in the pickled beet brine for at least 6 hours or overnight, shaking or rotating the eggs occasionally for even color. Keep the unpeeled eggs in the fridge until the next step.</li>
        <li>Peel the 3 or 4 non-marinated eggs and cut them in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Remove the yolks and place them in a small mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>This is the tricky part! Remove the marinated eggs from the brine. Slice off a small portion of the egg's bottoms so the bottom is flat and the eggs can easily stand upright.  Cut off the top quarter (¼) of each marinated egg. If the yolk isn’t exposed after cutting off the top, carefully carve out a hole on top with a paring knife. Scoop out the yolks with a small spoon and add them to the mixing bowl with the other yolks. Repeat for all the marinated eggs.</li>
        <li>Return the marinated eggs (now hollow) to the brine while you prepare the filling, so they can get some color on top.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: Use a fork to mash the egg yolks with the goat cheese, mustard, turmeric, lemon juice, mayonnaise, garlic salt, and onion powder until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. If you don’t have piping equipment, use a ziplock bag with a small corner cut off.</li>
        <li>Pat the eggs dry. Pipe the filling into the hollows of the eggs, rotating the bag slightly at the end for a nice swirled finish on top.</li>
        <li>Optional: Heat the butter in a small pan until bubbling, then fry sage leaves for about 1 minute until crisp. Remove the leaves with tongs and set on a paper towel to drain.  Skip this step if garnishing with fresh tarragon.</li>
        <li>Garnish the traditional non-marinated eggs with chopped chives and smoked paprika.</li>
        <li>Garnish the beet-marinated eggs with the fried sage leaves or fresh tarragon leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Serve with a side of red punch, and prepare for your upcoming Waffle Party. Praise Kier!</li>
